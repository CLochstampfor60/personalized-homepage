# personalized-homepage

## Description:

- Develop a simple, dynamic, responsive and aesthetically appealing homepage for my personal computing endeavors.

The current temperature and corresponding weather icon dynamically adjusts during the day along with pleasant greeting. At the bottom, there are is simple navigation shortcut list for the user to operate instead of a toolbar or other technological tool.

- The web application runs several applications in the browser with dynamic updates. Applications include HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Netlify, OpenWeather API, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome.

## User Story:

- I WANT to create an appealing and practical Home-Page,
- SO THAT I can view the current date, time, weather, and provide easy access to my favorite navigation shortcuts I use on a regular basis.

## Future Adjustments and Opportunities:

- Security: best business and security practices, hide the public WeatherApp API using Netlify Serverless Functions, dotenv, etc.

- Automatic and dynamic IPA fetching: fetching and using the User's current IP address to pull the physical location, then taking that location and pulling the current weather report using OpenWeather API. Best business practice for the average User who isn't accustomed to manually updating this code on their end.
